Put all the files of the system partition in the system folder
and execute extract-files.sh from the build environment root. A.e.
device/huawei/hwgra/extract-files.sh

Do it again when you change proprietary-files6.0.txt

You can download the files which I used to build the ROM
As far as I remember it's from the Europe Nord ROM
